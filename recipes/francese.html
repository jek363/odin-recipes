        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the chicken: Remove tenderloin from each chicken breast half, then fillet each half 
                into two slices. Pound all chicken, including tenderloins, to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl and pour in enough milk to completely cover; soak for 30 minutes

            </li>
            <li>
                Mix bread crumbs, Pecorino Romano, and parsley together in a bowl. Remove chicken from milk 
                and dredge in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned, 
                2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared baking dish, season with salt and pepper, 
                and place lemon slices over top. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the sauce: Pour wine into the skillet with chicken drippings and bring to a boil while 
                scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth and 
                lemon juice; boil until reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour wine mixture over chicken, then 
                drizzle orange liqueur over top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and chicken is no longer pink in the center 
                and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
