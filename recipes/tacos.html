        <h2>Taco Meat Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>0.5 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons taco seasoning, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>0.75 cup of water</li>

                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula,
                until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, 
                stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. 
                Drain fat if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook 1 minute. Add in tomato paste and water and cook,
                using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, and stir until well combined. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
